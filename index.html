								<h3>Hello!</h3>
								<p>My name is Nicholas Lai and I am a dedicated First Year student interested in renewable wave and solar energy and its application within robotics. </a></p>
								<p><i>This website showcases the my experience and all of the work that I have done. Feel free to navigate through the tabs on the previous page!</i></p>

								<h3>Background</h3>
								<p>Growing up in the Boston area, I was always surrounded by a ton of great minds, but I never really knew what I wanted to do when I grew up. Whenever someone from my family would ask me, I would always just shrug and say something like “I don't know, something that will probably make me a lot of money.” Within, my only real goals for my future was to just enjoy the work that I do. I had grown up around a family that practically hated what they did for a living, but were forced to do what they did to sustain their lifestyle. Even though I had this goal, I really didn't know what path I would go down until much later on.</p>
								<p>My love for problem-solving and designing really started to flourish in (and after) my junior year of high school, when I decided to take AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism. At my high school, that year was the first year that it had been offered during course selection for five years. I took it out on a whim with three of my friends and have never turned back since.</p>
								<p>My teacher, Mr. Osowiecki ran the class well, it is still my favorite class I have ever taken to this day. Instead of standing in front of the class and writing Maxwell's equations down on the board, he let the students do both the teaching and the learning themselves. Therefore, we built a tight community of 11 students that were (and still are) some of the smartest people that I have ever met, learning about Kirchhoff's Loop Laws and so much more. We got to put into practice what we were learning in class and actually see it play out right in front of our eyes. We built motors out of water bottles and made thermostats using Arduinos.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_5007.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p><i>Yes, that is the right hand rule.</i></p>
								<p>After this class was really when I set myself on engineering and electrical engineering specifically. It felt like after that class, pursuing electrical engineering as a major was the easiest choice I could ever make. I loved learning all about the concepts in that class and I loved how we learned with our hands. I loved working in that small community of people that just wanted to grow and learn more. I wanted all of that. Electrical engineering would allow me to dig deeper into topics that interested me and would also allow me to work in small collaborative groups, all working towards one end goal.</p>
								<p>And after that, it never really stopped. I bought Arduino learning kits, self taught myself programming languages, watched countless YouTube videos about random things relating to electrical engineering and electromagnetic physics, and so much more.</p>
								<p>I even got a chance to intern with Harvard John A. Paulson School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences. Over that summer, I got to work and talk to many alumni and current students about their work and soak in so much information about the things that they loved doing. I learned about 2D structures like graphene and its applications within electronics, talked to a doctorate student that was trying to use machine learning in order to communicate with sperm whales, and much much more. On top of that, I even got to write my own articles about them for the Harvard SEAS website! Just like I had expected, my internship with Harvard SEAS only added fuel to my fire.</p>
								<p>From there, I applied to Georgia Tech and that's where I am now. I joined a few clubs whose work really interested me and I have loved working with them and on my own projects. And I don't really plan on stopping or slowing down at all.</p>
								<p>As of now, I want to pursue both robotics and renewable energy because of how much opportunity there is to grow. I think that there is still so much room for these two industries to expand and that really excites me. However, like anything else in life, I'm sure that it is subject to evolve or even completely change. Maybe there's something out there in the vast world of engineering that I don't know yet that will excite me even more. That's what makes electrical engineering so fun!</p>

								<h3>Sunflower Project</h3>
								<p>With this project, I wanted to make an "artificial sunflower." Using 4 light dependent resistors (LDR), an Arduino Nano, 2 servo motors to allow for rotation along the yaw and pitch axis, and 3D printed parts, I wanted to design something that would autonomously follow a light source. </p>
								<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NqYztsOU9bg?si=TYlAo26MBrWs2XEs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
								<p><br>First, I tested whether the servo motor was able to move based on the brightness and direction of the light. As seen in the test video, the servo motor seemed to be pretty responsive to the changes in the orientation of the light. From there, I felt confident enough to move onto the next step of my project.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/thumbnail_image.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The next step was 3D modeling the sunflower using SolidWorks. As seen in the Assembly, I modeled the pot, lid, stalk, and the face of the sunflower to accommodate for all the design goals that I wanted. This included designing individual parts that would allow the sunflower to freely rotate with minimal wires/electronics showing.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Screenshot (7).png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Looking ahead, I will have to 3D print my model and modify the code to account for all the rotations. Without physical parts, it's a bit hard to test my code, but this is what I have for now.</p>
								
								<h3>Custom Solar MPPT Project (Club)</h3>
								<p>Working alongside 3 other members of a team, our goal for this project was to write firmware for our maximum power point tracking device on the STM32G474CEU6 microcontroller using the STM32IDE. In order to do this, we needed to receive voltage/current/irradiance data from the solar panels, write an algorithm to calculate the maximum power point, communicate with the hardware to invoke change, and send data back to a web server.</p>
								<p>First, we started by choosing and writing an algorithm that could maximize the power that went to our load (the battery) by tracking the optimal operating voltage. We chose an incremental conductance algorithm, that essentially would track the derivative of the IV curve "made" by the solar panel. Based on the input data that we received through I2C, we can calculate in which direction to adjust our power output.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Screenshot (3).png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>By constantly adjusting the duty cycle of a square wave using a pulse width modulator controller, we can continuously update how long the capacitor is charged, which in turn determines the boost ratio. We do this by sending that signal and its complement to the two MOSFETs in our boost converter with some dead time to ensure that they are never on at the same time. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Screenshot (4).png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Lastly, once we implemented CAN to facilitate communication between our algorithm and GTSR's web server and implemented overcurrent detection, we began to test our algorithm using simulations (currently, we don't have the physical hardware for testing). To do this, we hard coded a sample diode equation into MATLAB, which simulates the solar cell. As shown in the graph above, our algorithm is accurately tracking and increasing the power output. 
								<p>Looking towards the future, we are going to work towards improving the start-up behavior of our algorithm, which would reduce the amount of iterations our algorthm goes through before reaching the maximum power point.</p>


								<h3>Microtransat Project (Club)</h3>
								<p>The Microtransat Challenge is a challenge to cross the Atlantic Ocean only with a 2.4 meter autonomous boat, that no collegiate team has ever done before. As a group, we are very early in our development. As the sole member of the Electrical Team, I am currently starting the writing and integrating the firmware for the majority of the control systems on the boat. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/sensors_wiring.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Specifically, I've started by creating individual Arduino sketches for each sensor and part that we are planning to put on the boat and the test versions (IMU, GPS, stepper motor driver, RC controls, etc.). The picture above is the test of the IMU for our boat. Eventually, I (with the help of some other members) will start working on integrating all of the parts together to build the full control algorithm. </p>
								<p>Additionally, I've started research on implementating of solar cells to power our boat, but this will probably be a problem for the future. </p>
									
								<h3>Aquabots NESO/Swimmer Undergraduate Research Group</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Screenshot (14).png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This spring semester, I joined the NESO/Swimmer team. We are working with a Senior Design team to design and protype an egg-size underwater robotic vehicle to gather data on the species, Metridium Senile, specifically in the larvae stage. My role will be to design PCB that have all the sensors (temperature, light sensitivity, conductivity, movement speed, chlorophyll) that the scientists who were are working with want, while also maintaining our small form factor. I also want to start working on the communication system between the NESO/Swimmer vehicles and our above-water pingers. </p>
